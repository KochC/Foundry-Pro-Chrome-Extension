# Foundry Pro Chrome Extension
## Purpose of the Extension
The Foundry Pro Chrome Extension is a tool designed to enhance the user experience of developers working on the Palantir Foundry platform, which is a data integration, management, and analysis platform.

The Chrome Extension provides additional functionality and features that are not available in the standard platform, such as custom search and shortcut keys, allowing developers to more easily and efficiently work with the data and tools available on the Palantir Foundry platform.

Furthermore, the Palantir Foundry Chrome Extension is an open-source tool that can be modified and improved by the development community. The extension's source code is available on GitHub, where developers can contribute by adding new features, fixing bugs, or improving the overall user experience.

The Palantir Foundry Chrome Extension is not an official tool provided by Palantir Technologies, but was created and is maintained by a group of developers who use Palantir Foundry. The tool is free to use and is not associated with any commercial entity.

Overall, the Palantir Pro Chrome Extension is a community-driven solution that provides additional features to enhance the development experience on Palantir Foundry.

## Data privacy disclaimer
It is important to note that the extension does not send any user data or usage information to any third-party servers or collect any data in any way.

The extension uses the `chrome.storage.sync` API, which is provided by the Chrome browser, to save user configuration data in a secure and private manner. The `chrome.storage.sync` API stores data in the user's Google Account, where it is encrypted and can only be accessed by the user who installed the extension. This ensures that the user's configuration data is safe and private and is not accessible by any third parties.

Overall, the Palantir Foundry Chrome Extension respects the privacy of its users and ensures that any user data is securely stored and not sent or collected in any way.

## What is a Chrome Extension
A Chrome extension is a software program that can be installed into the Chrome web browser to add functionality to it. Chrome extensions are created using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and they can interact with the content on web pages or with other Chrome browser features.

Chrome extensions can be used for a wide range of purposes, such as customizing the appearance of web pages, blocking ads, improving productivity, and providing additional features to online tools and platforms. They are distributed through the Chrome Web Store, where users can browse and install them with a single click.

Once installed, a Chrome extension runs in the background, and its functionality can be accessed through its icon in the browser toolbar or by interacting with the content on a web page. Users can easily enable or disable extensions, and they can configure their settings and permissions as needed.

Overall, Chrome extensions are a powerful way to extend the functionality of the Chrome web browser, and they are widely used by both developers and regular users alike to enhance their browsing experience.

## General overview
The Foundry Pro Chrome Extension is an open-source project that can be modified and improved by the development community. If you're interested in contributing to the extension or creating your own Chrome extension, here are some details about the Palantir Foundry Chrome Extension's development:

The Foundry Pro Chrome Extension is built using Manifest V3, which is the latest version of the Chrome extension manifest file. This version provides improved security, performance, and user privacy features, making it the recommended version for developing new Chrome extensions.

The extension is built using React, which is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The extension uses Node 14 as its development environment and uses the Webpack module bundler to compile and package the extension's source code.

For the UI components, the extension uses Blueprint, which is a UI toolkit developed by Palantir Technologies. Blueprint provides a set of reusable components and styles that can be used to quickly and easily build high-quality user interfaces that are consistent with the Palantir Foundry platform.
